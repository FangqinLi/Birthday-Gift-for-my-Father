# Birthday-Gift-for-my-Father

## He is an IT man and was the first one who taught me how to write code, so I came up with this idea of making him a website recording his life as his birthday gift-although it's a very simple one. Maybe I'll imprrove it and add some fancy stuff afterwards.
## The photos are rather private, so I didn't upload them.
